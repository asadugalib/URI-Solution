disclaimer: dont see my solution before your 100% afford. 

problem solving is the best idea for logic developement.
so when you learn new programming language try to solve problem to sharp your abilty in that language and develope your logic.
during problem solving, try to solve a problem by yourself.. if you need any help search google, w3school, geeksforgeeks, stackoverflow etc..
be patient you can solve anything. if you stuck in any point. think it as a gift you will learn something new form that point.
